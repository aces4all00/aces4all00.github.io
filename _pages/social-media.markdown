# Social Media

Having grown frustrated with how much of big tech social media (Meta, Twitter, Reddit to name a few) addresses accessibility for everyone, the blind and visually impaired in particular, I have largely left them in favor of more open platforms like [Mastodon](<https://joinmastodon.org/servers>) and [Lemmy](<https://join-lemmy.org/instances>). Being open source, where features and  solutions do not already exist, anyone can contribute to creating them.

For me, the fediverse, of which Mastodon and Lemmy are parts of, has proven to be much more inclusive and accessible than the big tech platforms I left...also much less commercial, angry, or jaded. It is proving to be a very welcome change and I may explore more of what the fediverse has to offer. For now tou can:

- <a rel="me" href="https://dragonscave.space/@BlindSysEng_Social">find me here on Mastodon</a>

- [find me here on Lemmy](<https://rblind.com/u/NoConfigence2192>)

I don't have a lot of content either place yet as I have just gotten started and there is a bit of a learning curve with both. Once I have become more familiar with them and have settled down a bit I'll probably look into what else the fediverse has to offer.
