Welcome to my new site and please excuse the mess. As you can see it is a work in progress. It will improve over time as I learn more about what I'm doing and what I like.

The end goal is for me to have a space of my own that I can use to showcase my work as well as share bits of my journey as I continue to adapt to my changing vision.

As someone that almost exclusively has to use screen readers now I am relearning how to write and code using these new (to me) tools. Working with this site provides a good avenue for me to do both.

My largest immediate goal is to get back in the habit of writing daily. Until that habit becomes well established, and as long as what I write is coherent and understandable, I will not initially be concerned with things like spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Those I will introduce as my habits improve.
