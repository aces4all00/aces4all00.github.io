First and foremost I'm enjoying the story just like it is. As long as you keep telling it I'll probably stick around with or without modification. That said using more color contrast between text and the background around the text on the settings menus and on the in-game tablet would make it easier for me to read what's there. For me this is more of a whishlist/nice-to-have item so no worries eith way. 

From the experiments I was able to run it looks like you are variations of something close to:
- Background: Violet (`#A914AE`) over a textured image
- Foreground (text): Blue (`#0000ff`)

The blue on violet are a bit too similar in brightness for me to see easily. When I plug them into a contrast calculator (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker in this case) it shows a contrast ratio of `1.39:1` (I find `4.5:1` and better easiest).

Playing with the sliders a bit was using the same color family I found a couple of options that were easier for me to read:
1. Same blue (`#0000FF`) on a much lighter violet (`#F1A4F4`) ![Same blue on a much lighter violet](/assets/images/BlueOnLighterColor.png)
1. Darker blue (`#00007A`) and slightly lighter violet (`#E243EA`) ![Darker blue and slightly lighter violet](/assets/images/DarkerBlueOnLighterViolet.png)
